    title: "Attache ta tuque!",
    text: "This phrase literally (and hilariously) translates as 'attach your tuque.' For you non-Canadian folk, 'tuque' is our word for a beanie or a knitted hat that's worn in the winter time. This command has the meaning of 'hold on tight!' in English. For example, if you're driving with a friend and they're planning on speeding up, they might declare 'attache ta tuque!' before hitting the accelerator.",
  },
  {
    title: "Fais-le au plus sacrant!",
    text: "This is another command that translates to 'do it quickly!' This expression literally translates to 'do it the most slammingly' coming from the Quebec verb sacrer that means 'to slam.' ",
  },
  {
    title: "Finâ€¦ Fine",
    text: "This simple word is an adjective in Quebec slang. While literally meaning 'fine,' it translates to the word 'nice' or 'sweet' in English. For example, you may tell a friend that you scored the highest mark on the French test, and they may reply fin! ('sweet!') showing how impressed they are.",

  {
    title: "C'est le fun!",
    text: "I've used this expression extensively thus far, and it translates to 'it's awesome!' coming from the English word 'fun.'",
